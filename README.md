# DesignByNumbers-alphabet

#### Studies and derivatives of Maeda's [Design By Number](https://dbn.media.mit.edu/whatisdbn.html) 26 letter experiment

>***What is DBN?***
>
>*Design By Numbers was created for visual designers and artists as an introduction to computational design. It is the result of a continuing endeavor by Professor John Maeda to teach the “idea” of computation to designers and artists. It is his belief that the quality of media art and design can only improve through establishing educational infrastructure in arts and technology schools that create strong, cross-disciplinary individuals.*

Almost a year ago I wrote a sketch that would "translate" a set of DBN letter "commands" presented in the "DBN book", into Processing Python Mode equivalents (sort of).

- Parse dinamically the dbnletters.dbn file to create letter drawing functions in Processing Python Mode: [parse_dbn_letters](https://github.com/villares/DesignByNumbers-alphabet/tree/master/parse_dbn_letters)
- Genereate [dbn_letters.py] code for use with Processing Python Mode from the dbnletters.dbn file: [generate_dbn_letters_py](https://github.com/villares/DesignByNumbers-alphabet/tree/master/parse_dbn_letters) 
- An example sketch using the generated code: [dbn_letters_example](https://github.com/villares/DesignByNumbers-alphabet/tree/master/dbn_letters_example)
- Some other dead ends: maybe soon here

- A pixel font with the same pixels: soon link here
- A derivative "Fontstructed" font: soon link here
